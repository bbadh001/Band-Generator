# Band Name Generator
Writing good music is hard. But you know what's even harder? Coming up with a good band name. So, I did what any good artist would do... I made a computer do the entire creative process for me!

## How to Run
Simply run the the python script `band_gen.py`. While the scraping script is included (`scrape.py`), the dataset has already been scraped and placed into the text file `bandnames.txt` and will automatcially be read when running `band_gen.py`
